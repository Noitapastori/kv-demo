# kv-demo
Demo of my MAD front-end skills done as an exercise. Really fun project i must say. Tried out new things like parallax-scrolling and enumerator.

Used bootstrap framework and simple jquery numerator (available here: https://github.com/garethdn/jquery-numerator).

Atom was my text editor weapon-of-choice.

Images were taken from a .psd file provided. Just really wish i had personal photoshop at hand. Had to improvise with GIMP.

Tried it on a mobile device emulator and looked responsive. <3 Bootstrap.
